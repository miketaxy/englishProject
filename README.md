# englishProject
This is a backend project written in Java, which I use for learning English. In this project, you can input your own words and translate them. Additionally, there is a game feature that you can play with these words.

I don't want to end this project because, as I see it, Java programming is no longer as popular in our country. Therefore, I have decided to become a Python programmer.

Within this project, you can learn how to implement a JWT system using the latest Java version, set up an authorization system, and more.

I also have a frontend built with JavaScript using the Angular framework. If you find this project useful or need it for any purpose, you are welcome to use it
